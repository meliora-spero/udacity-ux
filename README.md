# UX Fundamentals & Design Research

Udacity's first project for the User Experience Nanodegree. 

1. Planed a research study (```research plan.pdf```), including research goals, recruiting criteria and scripts. 
2. Created interview guides designed to answer the research goals.
3. Designed a survey to answer the research questions, each survey question has its rationale written next to it.
4. Wrote a research report (```research report.pdf ```) to summarise the findings supported by data. Provided actionable recommendations and next steps.
5. Sketched out design by hand (```hand-drawn design.pdf```).
